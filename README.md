# BasicTrieTree
The last project in C-class.

#### Description:
In this project we buil a basic trie-tree. Words that are represented only in lowercase can be stored in the tree.
There are two printing functions:
* printAllWords -Print the list of words seen in the input along with the number of occurrences per word in ascending lexicographic order.
* printAllWordsR - Print the list of words seen in the input along with the number of occurrences per word in descending lexicographic order.

The words are read from text and the words are stored in memory with dynamic space allocation.
